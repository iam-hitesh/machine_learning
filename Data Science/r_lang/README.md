## Raw Data V/S Processed Data

### Raw Data

1. The original source of Data
2. Often hard to use for data analysis
3. Data analysis includes processing
4. Raw data may only need to be processed once.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_data](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_data)

### Processed Data

1. Data that is ready for analysis
2. Processing can include merging, subsetting, transforming,etc.
3. There may be standards for processing
4. All steps should be recorded

## Types of Data Science Questions

In approximate order of difficulty

* Descriptive - Eg. Census Analysis
* Exploratory - Scientific Analysis like reports
* Inferential - Small Results on Large Population
* Predictive - To use the data on some objects to predict values for another object
* Causal - To find out what happens to one variables when you make another variable change.
* Mechanistic - Understand the exact changes in variables that lead to changes in other variables for individual objects.


## About Descriptive Analyses

Goal : Describe a set of Data

* The first kind of data Analysis performed
* Commonly applied to the census Data
* The Description and interpretation are different steps.
* Description can usually not be generalized without additional statistical modelling.


## What is Data

Data are values of qualitative or quantitative variables, belonging to a set of items.
qualitative - Eg. Country of Origin,Gender,Mechanistic
quantitative - Eg. Age, Height, etc.
