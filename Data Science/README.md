# Data Science

Data Science is a mixture of statistics and probability, algorithms and codes. So, Data Science is all about algorithms and mathematics to implement together using programming. Selection of the right algorithms and methods, is of uttermost importance in Data Science. We can learn R or Python or both for Data Science, as both possess a large library for Data Science. So, we will first learn Programming for Data Science.
We will Start it with Python, and then switch to R.

## Data Science has 6 major Fields
* Data Mining
* Machine Learning
* Statistics & Probability
* Data Analysis
* Big Data
* Data Engineering
