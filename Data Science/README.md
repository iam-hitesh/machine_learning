# Data Science

Data Science is the Mixture of Statistics and Probability, Algorithms and Codes. So, Data Science is all About Algorithms and Maths to implement together using Programming. Selection of right Alogrithms and Method is very important in Data Science. We can learn R or Python or Both for Data Science as both have a large library for Data Science. So we will first learn Programming for Data Science.
We will Start it with Python and then R.

## Data Science have 6 Major Fields
1. Data Mining
2. Machine Learning
3. Statistics & Probability
4. Data Analysis
5. Big Data
6. Data Engineering

So choose one field and work on Data Science.

Check Python Lession Now and learn Python.Check comments used in Python files for better understanding.
